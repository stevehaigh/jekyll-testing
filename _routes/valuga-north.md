Frequently skied once it gets in to condition, and easily accessed if you ski with a guide (the tiny cable car won't let you on with skis if you're not with a guide). However, it's not an easy route and the dangers are real, sadly people have died skiing this in recent years.

For those without a guide who feel they can make the right decisions on their own then access is via a climb up the South Face of the Valuga. Exit the top station of the main Valugabahn and head up, there'll be a boot pack in place.

The top is airy and requires careful skiing as you traverse the very steep north face to get to the descent via the west face. Once that's navigated safely there's wide open skiing and various options, either taking you down to Zuers, or with a bit of hiking over to Lech. Although the top section is across the North Face, most routes are actually down the West Face, a descent of the true North Face would require a _very_ long hike back out.

Return using the lift system via Alpe Rauz.
