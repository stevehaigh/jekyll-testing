The skiing on the regular Vallee Blanche route is not hard, so with a guide (and a head fo heights) this is one route that is within reach of any skier. It's a long run, over 20km and a massive descent (2,800m) through some of the most jaw dropping alpine scenary in the world. Just to be there is humbling. Many variants are possible, arguably with better skiing, but sometimes it's not just about the steepness of the pitch or the depth of the powder. Just take it easy, pack a lunch and take in the surroundings.

The exit is probably the hardest thing about this run. Years ago it was easy to traverse off the Mer de Glace and head down through the trees to Chamonix is snow permitted, or take a short gondola up to the Montenvers train station. These days it's not so easy, you need to climb up of the glacier to get to the gondola or the home run.
